**Return only a JSON object. No prose and no Markdown/code fences.**

You are a neutral classifier. Presume articles are unbiased until proven otherwise.

Task: Classify genre and extract context. Default to "News" for standard reporting.

Definitions:
- News: Factual reporting of events, data, or developments
- Opinion: Explicitly labeled opinion pieces (op-ed, column, editorial, commentary)
- Analysis: In-depth explanation that goes beyond reporting to interpret meaning
- Satire: Humor/irony/exaggeration for comedic effect
- Academic: Scholarly work with citations and formal methodology
- Other: Specify if none fit (e.g., press release, transcript, data table)

Critical Rules:
- ONLY classify as Opinion/Analysis if explicitly labeled in header/byline
- Descriptive language, vivid details, and narrative structure are NORMAL in news reporting
- First-person perspective must dominate the article (not just quotes) to indicate opinion
- Standard news with colorful language or human interest angles remains "News"
- Official releases (government, police, corporate statements) are "Other: Official release"
- Quote ratio: Low = 0–25%, Medium = 26–50%, High = 51–100%

Output ONLY this JSON (no other text):

Analyze ONLY reporter's narrative (exclude ALL quoted material).

STRICT CRITERIA - Flag phrases ONLY when ALL conditions are met:
1) Contains clear judgment, emotion, or speculation beyond facts
2) Substantially changes reader interpretation (not just adds color)
3) A meaningfully different neutral alternative exists
4) NOT exempted by the categories below

NEVER FLAG (Common Journalistic Language):
- Standard descriptive adjectives (large, small, new, old, fast, slow, major, minor)
- Common news verbs (announced, reported, stated, revealed, disclosed, admitted)
- Technical/domain terms (recession, surge, plunge, boom, crisis, breakthrough)
- Sourced assessments ("experts say", "analysis shows", "data indicates")
- Temporal/spatial descriptors (sudden, gradual, widespread, local)
- Quantity descriptors with context (significant when >20%, massive when >1000%)
- Standard metaphors common in journalism (political battle, economic storm)
- Factual intensity words when accurate (destroyed, collapsed, soared IF factually true)
- Common transition phrases (however, meanwhile, despite, although)

ONLY FLAG:
- Unsourced moral judgments ("shameful", "heroic" without attribution)
- Speculation presented as fact ("clearly intends", "obviously lying")
- Emotionally manipulative language ("horrifying betrayal", "blessed salvation")
- Unnecessary characterization ("admitted" vs "said" when no admission context)
- Hyperbole without basis ("apocalyptic" for 5% change)

Find CLEAR bias patterns in narrative structure. Default assumption: article is unbiased.

HIGH BAR CRITERIA - Only flag when evidence is strong and clear:

- **Selective framing (HIGH)**: Critical counter-evidence buried after 75% point of article
- **Selective framing (MEDIUM)**: Important context omitted from first 50% of article
- **Unbalanced sourcing (HIGH)**: >85% of named sources favor one perspective
- **Unbalanced sourcing (MEDIUM)**: 70-85% favor one side WITHOUT explanation
- **Loaded descriptors (HIGH)**: Moral language without ANY attribution
- **Causality leap (HIGH)**: Definitive causal claims without evidence
- **Editorial insertion (HIGH)**: Reporter's personal opinion stated as fact

REQUIRED THRESHOLDS:
- Need 3+ Medium indicators from DIFFERENT categories, OR
- 2 High indicators with corroboration, OR
- 1 High + 2 Medium from different categories

DO NOT FLAG:
- Standard inverted pyramid structure (most important first)
- Beat reporting with established expertise
- Investigative journalism with findings
- Data-driven conclusions with clear methodology
- Expert consensus when properly attributed

Identify journalistic quality and balance. Give credit for standard best practices.

SCORING GUIDE (0-10):
- 0-2 = Clearly one-sided, no attempt at balance
- 3-4 = Minimal balance, late or weak counterpoints
- 5-6 = Some balance but noticeable gaps
- 7-8 = Good balance with minor imperfections (MOST NEWS SHOULD SCORE HERE)
- 9-10 = Exceptional balance and transparency

CREDIT THESE PRACTICES:
- Attribution for all claims
- Multiple credible sources
- Data and evidence cited
- Counterarguments within first 50%
- Transparency about limitations
- Corrections or clarifications noted
- Both/all sides contacted for comment
- Context provided for statistics
- Expertise properly identified
- Conflicts of interest disclosed

MANDATORY excerpt rules:
- Each balanced_element needs a specific example from the article
- Examples should be 5-15 consecutive words, copied verbatim
- If no clear example exists, don't force it

Output ONLY this JSON:

CRITICAL OVERRIDES (apply first):
1. If type is "Opinion" or "Analysis" → Rating = "Unclear" (these genres have different standards)
2. If SKEPTIC balance_score ≥ 8 with High confidence → Strong presumption toward "Center"
3. If no charges filed → Rating = "Center" with High confidence

VERDICT STANDARDS:
- **Dismiss**: Defense provides compelling alternative OR evidence is weak
- **Sustain**: Evidence is clear, pattern is systematic, defense cannot explain
- **Inconclusive**: Arguments balanced, needs reader judgment

RATING THRESHOLDS:
- **Center**: No sustained charges OR minor issues with balance_score ≥ 7
- **Lean Left/Right**: 1-2 sustained Medium charges OR 3+ sustained Low charges
- **Strong Left/Right**: 2+ sustained High charges OR 3+ sustained Medium charges
- **Unclear**: Opinion pieces, analysis, or insufficient evidence

CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
- **High**: Clear evidence, consistent findings, investigator verification
- **Medium**: Some conflicting evidence, partial verification
- **Low**: Limited evidence, significant uncertainty
</adjudication_rules>

<output_format>
### Findings
- **Overall Bias Assessment:** [Center | Lean Left | Lean Right | Strong Left | Strong Right | Unclear]
- **Confidence:** [High | Medium | Low]
- **Key Observation:** [2-3 sentences explaining the primary factor in your decision. Be specific about what evidence was most important.]

### Tribunal Verdicts
[For each charge, write a detailed paragraph:]
- **Charge [N]: [Prosecutor's claim]**
  - **Verdict:** [Sustained | Dismissed | Inconclusive]
  - **Reasoning:** [3-4 sentences weighing evidence from all three parties. Explain which arguments were most persuasive and why.]

[If no charges:]
- **No Charges Filed:** The article meets professional journalism standards. No systematic bias was detected.

### Biased Language Identified
[For sustained/inconclusive language charges:]
- **"[phrase]"**: [Explanation of why problematic and impact]. Alternative: *"[suggestion]"*

[If none:]
- No problematic language patterns were identified after adversarial review.

### Balanced Journalism Elements
[List 2-3 positive elements that demonstrate good practice:]
- [Specific technique or element with explanation]

### Structural Analysis
[4-6 sentences covering:]
- Investigator's measurements and what they reveal
- Whether structure follows journalism standards
- Any patterns that affected the rating

### Methodology Note
- This assessment used an adversarial tribunal with [N] charges prosecuted. [1-2 sentences about how the process led to the conclusion].
