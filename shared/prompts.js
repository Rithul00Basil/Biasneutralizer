Task: Classify genre and extract context. If uncertain, use "Unknown" rather than guessing.

Definitions:
- News: Timely reporting, minimal opinion
- Opinion: Explicit viewpoint/commentary
- Analysis: Explains significance, includes interpretation
- Satire: Humor/irony, not literal
- Academic: Scholarly, citations, formal
- Other: Specify if none fit

Rules:
- Do not judge ideology or search for bias
- Estimate quoted material: count approximate word percentage inside quotation marks
- Low = 0-30%, Medium = 31-60%, High = 61-100%

1. Value-laden (judgmental adjectives/adverbs, insinuating verbs, speculative hedges)
2. A neutral, precise alternative exists

Do NOT flag:
- Precise technical/legal terms ("felony", "GDP contracted")
- Neutral quantifiers backed by facts
- Demonstrably factual descriptors

Require: Provide neutral alternative for each flagged phrase

Find bias indicators in NARRATIVE ONLY (ignore quotes). Do NOT assume bias exists.

Flag ONLY if falsifiable criteria met:
- Selective framing: Relevant counter-info buried (after para 8) while opposing view leads
- Unbalanced sourcing: >70% of attributions favor one side without comparable scrutiny
- Loaded descriptors: Narrative uses judgmental language without factual basis
- Causality leap: Claims causation without evidence (correlation presented as causation)
- Editorial insertion: Adjectives judging motives/morality

Require: At least 2 independent indicators OR 1 High-strength indicator corroborated by structure

  createSkepticPrompt: (contextData, textToAnalyze) => `Context: ${contextData}

Identify genuine balance/quality signals. Do NOT manufacture symmetry or require false balance.

Credit as balanced ONLY if:
- Opposing perspectives are credibly sourced AND proportionate to claim importance
- Transparently communicates uncertainty/limitations
- Strong, checkable attribution provided
- Relevant context (history, data, scope) included
- Acknowledges complexity without oversimplifying

Do NOT require "both sides" if one lacks credible support (e.g., scientific consensus)

Rules:

- Exclude: Paraphrases, summaries, indirect speech
- Assess: How the article frames each quote (attribution style)
- Note: Loaded language in quotes reflects SOURCE bias, not article bias

   */
  createFramingPrompt: (contextData, textToAnalyze) => `Context: ${contextData}

Examine story structure. Distinguish editorial judgment from manipulation.

Flag as manipulation ONLY if:
- Headline contradicts body content
- Lead omits essential counter-facts acknowledged later
- Passive voice systematically obscures agents in contested actions
- Causal claims in headline/lead lack support

Do NOT flag standard inverted pyramid (leading with news hook)

BALANCED ELEMENTS

- One sentence on how quotes are separated from narrative bias and how evidence thresholds avoid false positives.
