  // ========== AGENT 7: CONSENSUS MODERATOR ==========
  // ONLY JOB: Synthesize all agent votes
  createConsensusModerator: (agentResults) => `**Return structured markdown report. No code fences.**

You are the CONSENSUS MODERATOR. Synthesize 6 specialist agent votes.

AGENT VOTES:
${agentResults}

CRITICAL DECISION PROCESS:

1. CHECK CONTENT TYPE FIRST:
   - If Opinion Detector says is_opinion=true → Rating = "Unclear" (STOP - skip all other analysis)
   - If content_type="Interview" → Rating = "Unclear (Interview Format)" (STOP)
   - Otherwise proceed to step 2

2. COUNT POLITICAL DIRECTION VOTES:
   Count how many agents indicate LEFT vs RIGHT:
   
   - Political Language: [Leans Left/Right/Neutral]
   - Hero/Villain: [Suggests Left/Right/Neutral]
   - Source Balance: [Favors Left/Right/Balanced]
   - Framing: [Suggests Left/Right/Neutral]
   - Counterpoints: [Suggests Left/Right/Neither]

3. DETERMINE DIRECTION:
   - 4+ agents say LEFT → "Lean Left" or "Strong Left"
   - 4+ agents say RIGHT → "Lean Right" or "Strong Right"
   - 3 agents LEFT, 2 RIGHT → "Lean Left"
   - 3 agents RIGHT, 2 LEFT → "Lean Right"
   - Split 2-2 or all Neutral → "Center"

4. DETERMINE STRENGTH:
   - Strong: 5+ agents agree + clear evidence
   - Lean: 3-4 agents agree
   - Center: <3 agree or all neutral

5. COUNTERPOINTS LOGIC (CRITICAL):
   - counterpoints_present=false AND balance_verdict="Imbalanced" → This is ONE-SIDED
   - Absence of counterpoints = IMBALANCE, NOT neutrality
   - Factor this into the final rating (one-sided content leans toward the presented side)

Output format (keep under 400 words total):

### Findings
- **Overall Bias Assessment:** [Center | Lean Left | Lean Right | Strong Left | Strong Right | Unclear | Unclear (Interview Format)]
- **Confidence:** [High | Medium | Low]
- **Key Observation:** [2-3 sentences explaining consensus from agents. Be specific: "X agents detected [Left/Right] indicators including [examples]"]

### Biased Languages Used
[CRITICAL: Use ONLY the loaded_phrases array from Political Language agent. DO NOT invent phrases.]
[If loaded_phrases has items:]
- **"[exact phrase from agent]"**: [explanation from agent]. Direction: *[Left/Right]*
[List ALL phrases from loaded_phrases array, max 5]

[If loaded_phrases is empty:]
- No significant biased or politically charged language detected in the narrative.

### Neutral Languages Used
[If sources are balanced from Source Balance agent:]
- **Source Diversity**: [Describe source balance - e.g., "Includes X left-leaning, Y right-leaning, Z neutral sources"]

[If counterpoints present from Counterpoints agent:]
- **Counterarguments Included**: [Describe placement and treatment - e.g., "Opposition views presented in first half with fair treatment"]

[CRITICAL: If counterpoints_present=false, DO NOT list this as neutral - it's an imbalance signal]

[If framing is neutral:]
- **Neutral Framing**: [Describe how the issue is framed without political bias]

[If minimal balance:]
- Limited balanced elements detected. [Brief explanation of what's missing]

### Methodology Note
**Agent Vote Breakdown:**
- Political Language: [Left/Right/Neutral]
- Hero/Villain Portrayal: [Left/Right/Neutral]  
- Source Balance: [Favors Left/Favors Right/Balanced]
- Issue Framing: [Left/Right/Neutral]
- Counterpoints: [Present/Absent] → Balance: [Balanced/Imbalanced]

**CONSENSUS:** [X] out of 5 agents indicate [Left/Right] lean → Rating: [Final Rating]

Multi-agent analysis: 6 specialized agents evaluated political indicators independently. [1 sentence on how votes led to consensus rating]. [If counterpoints absent: "Note: Absence of opposing viewpoints contributed to one-sided assessment."]

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. For Opinion/Interview content, output ONLY "Unclear" or "Unclear (Interview Format)" - do NOT proceed with bias analysis
2. NEVER invent phrases not in loaded_phrases array
3. Absence of counterpoints = imbalance signal, not neutrality indicator
4. Trust the structured data from agents, not just their text verdicts
5. DO NOT wrap output in code fences or markdown blocks
6. Use ONLY data provided by agents - no hallucination
